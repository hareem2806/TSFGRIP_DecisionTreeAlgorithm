# TSFGRIP_DecisionTreeAlgorithm
Objective : Evaluate the Iris dataset with Decision Tree Classifier

STEP BY STEP OVERVIEW :

The first step in any machine learning project is to prepare the data. In this project, the data is preprocessed by performing the following steps:

- Checking for Inconsistency in Data
- EDA
- Splitting Data
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Performance Metrics


Decision Tree Classifier: Decision Tree Classifiers are a type of tree-based machine learning algorithm. It works by building a tree of decision rules, which can then be used to predict the class of a new instance. The accuracy was 96.66%.

The results were analyzed through classification report and confusion metrics from sklearn library. Also some test data was used to evaluate model's performance.

Conclusion

This project has demonstrated how to use decision tree algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species.
